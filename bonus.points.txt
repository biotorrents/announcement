==Overview==
Nips are Oppaitime's currency. They are awarded to users for a wide range of reasons. They can also be spent to help other users or earn personal rewards.

==Earning Nips==
===Seeding===
You will be awarded nips for seeding torrents according to the following formula, per-hour, where [i]n[/i] is the number of torrents you're seeding:
[align=center][tex]$\left(\sum_{i=0}^n {\frac{\sqrt{\frac{size_{i}}{{1}\text{GiB}}}*1.5^{\frac{seedtime_{i}}{{1}\text{yr}}}}{\text{Max}\left(1,\ \frac{\sqrt{{{seeds_{i}}}+4}}{3}\right)}}\right)^{0.95}$[/tex][/align]

This earning rate will decay proportionally to the amount of nips you have stocked up. After you have accumulated two months worth of nips, your daily nip rate will be reduced by your total amount of nips over two months worth divided by 60. If your base nip rate is 100 nips per day, you will continue earning 100 nips per day until you have accumulated 6,000 nips. By the time you have accumulated 9,000 nips, you will be making 50 nips per day. You will stop gaining nips if you have 12,000 nips stocked up. This is to discourage hoarding and encourage spending.

===Screenshots===
Torrents with at least [b]4[/b] screenshots will earn an additional [b]30% nips/hr[/b]. It's in your best interest to make sure everything you upload or download has enough screenshots. Don't rely on other people!

===Store===
Upload credit can be exchanged for nips by visiting [url=https://oppaiti.me/store.php]the store[/url]. Be careful, and make sure you don't put yourself under your required ratio.

===Artist Bounty===
If you fill out an artist page with a description, similar artists, and preferably a relevant image you might be able to get some nips for your effort--as much as 500 nips at the discretion of staff.

===Wiki Bounty===
If you write a wiki article, or make large revisions to one, you might be able to earn some nips for your work. There's no hard maximum for the amount you can earn for an article, but particularly good articles or revisions will earn more nips.

==Spending Nips==
===Store===
You can spend your accumulated nips by visiting [url=https://oppaiti.me/store.php]the store[/url]. There, you can trade your nips for upload credit, make torrents temporarily freeleech, get yourself some extra invites, or buy some cosmetic badges to display on your profile and on the forums.

===Gifts===
Nips can also be sent to other users as a gift from their profile page, including an optional message. 10% of your gift will be taken by the system as tax, however you have the option to automatically adjust your gift amount for this tax.
