Hi, my handle is ohm. I'm humbled to announce [BioTorrents.de](https://BioTorrents.de), a reboot of Morgan Langille and Jonathan Eisen's 2010 service. Like its predecessor, it's not a pirate site.

[BioTorrents.de](https://BioTorrents.de) is the global DIYbio community's distributed data repository. The content includes richly annotated and searchable biological sequence and medical imaging data. The site is built on Oppaitime Gazelle and What.cd Ocelot.

Please find some thoughts on the philosophy behind the site, who it's useful for, and why we need another place to download biology data.

**Easy Uploads.** The upload form is self-explanatory and the rules largely go through each field in detail. RefSeq and UniProt autofill, and a FASTA and GenBank parser, are currently under development. There should be one form element that just knows what to do with the data you enter.

**Comfy Searches.** Gazelle is a great way to browse through data in the Artist - Album format. It doesn't feel like accessing a database in the cold, disinterested way of an institutional data dump.

**The database is valuable.** Besides the expanded validation and formatting


## Did BioTorrents fail?
