Hello. I'm seeking seedbox recommendations to help bootstrap the swarm on [BioTorrents.de](https://biotorrents.de), a torrent tracker for biological sequence and medical imaging data. Thanks for any advice you can provide.

**Are you OK with direct message offers from vendors?**

Yes, but only to discuss tax-deductible donations of server time on behalf of [BosLab](https://www.boslab.org), the 501c3 community biology lab where [BioTorrents.de](https://biotorrents.de) originated.

**What are your main reasons for getting a seedbox?**

I'm in the process of launching a semi-private science tracker for genomic and medical data, and would like to seed as much content on as fast connection as I can afford. I'm currently seeding from two residential locations.

**Do you have any specific requirements?**

I'm seeking a 1 Gbps uplink with as much storage and monthly transfer capacity as can be had for about $20 per month. The storage cap is the limiting factor right now, not the transfer cap.

**Are you looking for a shared or dedicated solution?**

Dedicated is preferred, but shared is okay if it helps meet the requirements above.

**Are you looking for managed or unmanaged solution?**

Unmanaged

**Please describe your Seedbox experience:**

My current setup is a Transmission instance seeding about 5,000 torrents from a home server on a residential connection, that I access and manage remotely behind a SOCKSv5 proxy. I would set up an rTorrent/ruTorrent instance on the seedbox in a similar way (Nginx reverse proxy to daemon listening on localhost).

**Currently with a provider or used one before?**

No

**What is your Linux experience?**

Professional development and systems administration for a sizeable public-sector organization.

**What is your monthly budget?**

$20

**Payment preferences or requirements?**

PayPal or debit preferred, Bitcoin not preferred.

**Do you need support for public trackers?**

The [BioTorrents.de](https://biotorrents.de) content distribution model is novel as far as I know: an authenticated private swarm on Tier 1, with three public backups on Tier 2 and forthcoming support for FTP/HTTP seeds.

**Routing: Tell us your continent:**

I'm currently seeding about 1â€“2 Mbps from North America and would prefer a European location.

**What kind of connection speeds do you need?**

At least 150 Mbps guaranteed with 1 Gbps burst available.

**How much monthly bandwidth is needed?**

2 TB is a reasonable limit because the data is rather niche.

**How much disk space do you need?**

4 TB is a good minimum, as I've allocated that much space on my home server.

**List some features you are looking for:**

The ability to install custom ISO images would be nice, for example to use OpenBSD-current, but it's not a strict requirement. I'll make do with whatever Linux images the service offers, preferring Debian.

**Anything else you think we should know?**

Thanks for helping me out!
